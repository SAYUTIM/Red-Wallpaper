The system always accepts keyboard input and will change to that color when a 6-digit RGB code is entered.  
No # is required.  

The screen goes full screen once you click on it.  
You can deactivate it with the escape key.  

It is recommended that the screen be brightened to the maximum.  

# The reason I made this
One day, I was studying in my notebook.  
The best way to memorize important words and phrases was to write them in red and then look at them through the red sheet, making them invisible.  
  
But suddenly I realized that I had to learn the words in red and then look at them through the red sheet.  "I'm tired of looking at my notebook through this red sheet every time."  
  
So I created this program.  
  
Now you don't have to look at your notes through the red sheet, just run this program, turn off the light in your room, put your notebook in front of the monitor, and you can make the important words in your notebook invisible without holding anything.  
  
Click on the screen and a white screen will illuminate your notes so that you can see the answers written in your notes.  
  
You may also find that you write important words and phrases in colors other than red.  
In case of such a case, this program always accepts keyboard input.  
After clicking on the screen, you can enter a 6-digit RGB code to change the color.  
When you change the color with RBG, the screen flashes red and blue for 0.3 seconds to make it clear that you have changed the color.  
  
Be careful with that flash if you are in a dark room and the screen is at maximum brightness.
